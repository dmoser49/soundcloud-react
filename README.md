# soundcloud-react

In learning react I've decided to take on this tutorial:
https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/

Day 1:
 - simple rendering by mapping through an array of objects
 - create different types of react components
    - create class component which holds state and has available functions such as componentWillMount and componentDidUpdate
    - create stateless functional component which has neither internal component state nor lifecycle methods
